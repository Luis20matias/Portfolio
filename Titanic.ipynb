This project is expected to be able to make an analysis of which variables have the greatest influence in one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history and find the accuracy in the classification on the people that survived or not. The dataset used for this project is taken from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)**.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the **second part**, it is used the dataset of train and test to validate the model. The Machine Learning classifier used is the **[Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html?highlight=random%20forest#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)**. In spite of this fact, the accuracy calculate is *0.76906*.\n",

It's used the **[K-Folds cross-validator](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html)** from the scikit learn that provides s train/test indices to split data in train/test sets. The mean of the accuracies found is *0.764310*.\n",

        "The **fourth part** is to add new variables in the training and test data to build a model of Machine Learning. The numerical variables add are Sex_binary, Age, P-class, SibSp, Parch, and Fare. It's used the **[RepeatedKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RepeatedKFold.html)** that repeats K-Fold n times with different randomization in each repetition.

Consequently, it is seen that in this data has a people with *'Miss', 'Mrs', 'Master', 'Col', 'Major' and 'Mr'* in their names. Furthermore, a lot of peolpe of this subset hasn't the number of their cabin notified. The **[Support vector machine (SVM)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)** to improve the accuracy of the project. On the whole, the accuracy in this part is *0.77511*, the best one in this project is bigger than the archive gender_submission\n",
